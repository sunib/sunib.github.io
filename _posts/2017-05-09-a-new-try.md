Testing around!

Just playing arround a bit to see if this new post is immediatly processed by github somehow.

I'm also curious to see if the new theme is beeing applied and if there is some notion of a newly added category
Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Some links:
* [hacker theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker)
* [How to write posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) especially intresting to see that it's all md, but it's also a yaml header.
